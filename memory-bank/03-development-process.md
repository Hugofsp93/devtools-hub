# Development Process

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setup
- Node.js v18 or higher required
- Clone repository
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Start development server with `npm run dev`

### 2. Code Organization
- Components in `src/components/`
- Each tool in its own directory
- Shared utilities in `src/utils/`
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

### 3. Development Guidelines
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement responsive design
- Support dark/light themes
- Write clean, documented code

### 4. State Management
- Use `usePersistedState` for all tool state
- Follow the pattern:
  ```typescript
  const [state, setState] = usePersistedState<StateType>('unique-key', initialState);
  ```
- Benefits:
  - Persists user preferences
  - Maintains state across page reloads
  - Improves user experience
  - Reduces need for backend storage

### 5. Testing
- Component testing (to be implemented)
- Integration testing (to be implemented)
- E2E testing (to be implemented)

### 6. Code Quality
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript for type checking
- Regular code reviews

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- `main` - Production branch
- `develop` - Development branch
- Feature branches for new tools
- Bug fix branches for issues

### Commit Guidelines
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers
- Follow conventional commits

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement changes
3. Run tests and linting
4. Create pull request
5. Code review
6. Merge to develop

## Deployment

### Build Process
1. Run tests
2. Build with `npm run build`
3. Preview with `npm run preview`
4. Deploy to Vercel

### Environment Setup
- Development: `npm run dev`
- Production: `npm run build`
- Preview: `npm run preview`

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update dependencies
- Run security audits
- Monitor performance
- Fix reported issues

### Documentation
- Keep README updated
- Document new features
- Update API documentation
- Maintain changelog

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Load time
- First contentful paint
- Time to interactive
- Bundle size

### Optimization
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Asset optimization
- Caching strategies
