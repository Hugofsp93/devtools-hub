# Architecture Documentation

## System Architecture
DevTools Hub follows a modern Single Page Application (SPA) architecture built with React and TypeScript. The application is structured as follows:

```
src/
├── components/         # Reusable UI components
│   ├── Layout.tsx     # Main layout wrapper
│   └── [ToolName]/    # Individual tool components
├── pages/             # Page components
├── utils/             # Utility functions
└── App.tsx           # Main application component
```

The application uses a component-based architecture where each tool is a self-contained module with its own directory. The main application is routed using React Router, with each tool having its own dedicated route.

## Design Patterns
1. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Each tool is implemented as an independent component
   - Components are organized in a modular structure
   - Reusable UI elements are separated into shared components

2. **Container/Presenter Pattern**
   - Layout component acts as a container for the entire application
   - Individual tool components are presenters focused on specific functionality

3. **Routing Pattern**
   - Client-side routing using React Router
   - Each tool has a dedicated route for direct access

4. **Theme Pattern**
   - Dark/Light mode implementation using Flowbite's theming system
   - Theme toggle component for user preference

## Data Flow
1. **Application State**
   - Local component state for tool-specific data
   - URL-based state management for routing
   - Theme state managed at the application level

2. **Component Communication**
   - Props for parent-child communication
   - Event handlers for user interactions
   - URL parameters for sharing tool states

## Security Considerations
1. **Client-Side Security**
   - Input validation for all user inputs
   - Safe handling of user-generated content
   - XSS prevention through React's built-in escaping

2. **Data Handling**
   - Local processing of sensitive data
   - No server-side storage of user data
   - Secure handling of API keys (when implemented)

## Database Schema
Not applicable - The application is currently client-side only with no database requirements. Each tool manages its own state in memory.

## Technical Decisions
1. **Framework Selection**
   - React 19 for modern component-based development
   - TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
   - Flowbite for consistent UI components and theming

2. **Build System**
   - Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
   - ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency

3. **UI/UX Decisions**
   - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
   - Dark mode support for better user experience
   - Modular tool structure for easy maintenance and updates

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Code splitting through React Router
   - Lazy loading of tool components
   - Optimized asset loading and bundling

5. **Development Workflow**
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - ESLint for code quality
   - Prettier for consistent formatting
   - Git for version control
